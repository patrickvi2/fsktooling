Tooling for figure skating events.

# Overview
Most tooling is based on the "DEU Meldeformular". Conversion is done from xlsx to csv.
The 3 main parts of the form will be exported to separate csv files:
- info header
- categories
- people (athletes and officials)

After extracting the information into csv files, they could be merged and further processed to retreive the actual discipline participants.

# Features / Scripts
1. Convert from "DEUMeldeformular" to
    - participant csv files
    - ODF xml files that can be read by the judging system FS manager (GUI available)
2. Get participant starting order from a FS manager SQL database
3. Copy participant files from plain folder structure to category / segment folder structure and sort with starting order
4. Merge PDF files
5. Create mp3 playlists
6. Convert DEU clubs and nations to XML
